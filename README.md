In this repository I will be uploading my learnings and code notebooks based on the course ML with Graphs CS224 by Stanford University taught by Dr. Jure Leskovec. 

In the Colab-1 I breifly coded the understanding the nature of the graph, understanding the tensor basics, clustering coefficients, page rank algorithm and then training the embeddings.  

In the file Building convolutional layer I wrote the code in developing the single GCN layer where we do all the operations for the node classification using the OOPs. 

In the GraphSAGE implementation I used the main difference between GCN and GraphSAGE and then implemented the single layer of the GraphSAGE using torch and classified the nodes labeled as hydrogen or oxygen.
