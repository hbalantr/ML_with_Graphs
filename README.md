In this repository I will be uploading my learnings and code notebooks based on the course ML with Graphs CS224 by Stanford University taught by Dr. Jure Leskovec. 

In the Colab-1 I breifly coded the understanding the nature of the graph, understanding the tensor basics, clustering coefficients, page rank algorithm and then training the embeddings.
